<h2>Short Bio</h2>
<p>Hello! I'm Iryna Malacina (Mah-LAH-see-nah), a researcher and doctoral candidate pursuing a Dr.Sc. at the <a href=" https://www.lut.fi/en/about-lut/faculties/lut-business-school"> Business School of LUT University </a> in Finland. I also earned my M.Sc. in Supply Management from LUT. <p>
<p>My primary research focus is on supply network analysis, a field about which I am deeply passionate. However, my intellectual curiosity extends beyond that. I have also explored a range of topics including innovation management, environmental sustainability, and public procurement. <p>
<p> When it comes to methodology, you could say I'm a data enthusiast. I am skilled in a variety of analytical methods, particularly those related to network analysis. Currently, I am delving deep into <a href=" https://www.google.com/search?q=exponential+random+graph+models&rlz=1C1GCEA_enUA1043UA1043&oq=Exponential+Random+Graph+Models&gs_lcrp=EgZjaHJvbWUqBwgAEAAYgAQyBwgAEAAYgAQyBwgBEC4YgAQyBwgCEAAYgAQyCAgDEAAYFhgeMggIBBAAGBYYHjIKCAUQABgPGBYYHjIICAYQABgWGB4yBggHEEUYPdIBBzQ0NGowajSoAgCwAgA&sourceid=chrome&ie=UTF-8 "> Exponential Random Graph Models</a>, but my toolkit also includes topic modeling, surveys, case studies, and literature reviews. Regardless of the method, I consistently bring a keen analytical eye to my work, which I consider to be one of my strengths. <p>
<p>Feel free to connect with me on social media or via email. I am always open to discussing new research ideas, exploring collaborative opportunities, or simply having engaging conversations about network analysis and supply management. <p>
